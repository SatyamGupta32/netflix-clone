# Netflix Clone

## Introduction
In this project, we'll create a basic clone of Netflix using HTML and CSS. While this won't replicate all the functionality of Netflix, it will focus on mimicking the layout and visual design of the homepage.

## Steps

### 1. Setup
- Create a new Folder for your project.
- Inside the Folder, create an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file.

### 2. HTML Structure
- Divide the layout into sections:
  - Header
  - Hero Section
  - Movie Categories
  - Footer

### 3. Nav bar
- Create the header section with the Netflix logo and navigation links.

### 4. Hero Section
- Design the hero section with a background image or video.
- Include a title and a brief description.

### 5. Movie Categories
- Create sections for different movie categories.
- Each section should contain movie thumbnails with titles.

### 6. Footer
- Design the footer section with links to various pages and social media icons.

### 7. Styling with CSS
- Apply styles to the HTML elements using CSS.
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout.
- Implement responsive design to make the clone mobile-friendly.

### 8. Responsive Design
- Test the layout on different screen sizes and adjust styles accordingly.
- Use media queries to make the design responsive.

### 9. Final Touches
- Add hover effects to enhance user experience.
- Optimize images and assets for faster loading.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can create a basic clone of Netflix using HTML and CSS. Remember that this is just a starting point, and you can always expand and improve upon it with additional features and functionality.
